# Fever code challenge

Welcome! We're thrilled to have you at this stage of the process. This challenge is designed to give us insight into your coding approach and problem-solving skills. Itâ€™s a simplified example of real-world scenarios we handle daily at Fever.

## About Fever

At Fever we work to bring experiences to people. We have a marketplace of events from different providers that are curated and then consumed by multiple applications. We work hard to expand the range of experiences we offer to our customers. Consequently, we are continuously looking for new providers with great events to integrate in our platforms. 

## The challenge

Your task is to develop a microservice that integrates events from an external provider into the Fever marketplace.

Even if this is just a disposable test, imagine that somebody will pick up this code and maintain it in the future. It will evolve new features will be added, existing ones adapted, and unnecessary functionalities removed. Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of any project.

> [!TIP]
> This should be conceived as a long-term project, not just one-off code.

The external provider exposes an endpoint: https://provider.code-challenge.feverup.com/api/events

This API returns a list of available events in XML format. Events that are no longer available will not be included in future responses. Here are three example responses over consecutive API calls:

- [Response 1](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/acalvotech/55223c0e5c55baa33086e2383badba64/raw/1cab82e2d1f3adc8d3b3dace0a409844bed698f0/response_1.xml)
- [Response 2](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/acalvotech/d9c6fc5a5920bf741638d6179c8c07ed/raw/2b4ca961f05b2eebc0682f21357d37ac0eb5c80a/response_2.xml)
- [Response 3](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/acalvotech/7c107daacfd05f32c1c1bcd7209d85ef/raw/ea4c4c8d2b7ccf2ae2be153d45353fb7187f5236/response_3.xml)

> [!WARNING]
> The API endpoint has been designed with real-world conditions in mind, where network requests donâ€™t always behave ideally. Your solution should demonstrate how you handle various scenarios that could occur in production environments. **Donâ€™t assume the API endpoint will always respond successfully and with low latency.**

## Your Task

You need to **develop and expose a single endpoint**:

- **API Spec:** [SwaggerHub Reference](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/luis-pintado-feverup/backend-test/1.0.0)
- The endpoint should accept `starts_at` and `ends_at` parameters and return only the events within this time range.
- Events should be included if they were ever available (with `"sell_mode": "online"`).
- Past events should be retrievable even if they are no longer present in the providerâ€™s latest response.
- The endpoint must be performant, responding in **hundreds of milliseconds**, regardless of the state of other external services. For instance, if the external provider service is down, our search endpoint should still work as usual. Similarly, it should also respond quickly to all requests regardless of the traffic we receive.

## Evaluation criteria

Your solution will be evaluated holistically, with special attention to:

- **Problem-Solution Fit:** How well your solution aligns with the given problem.
- **Adherence to API Spec:** Follow the provided OpenAPI specification.
- **Documentation:** Provide a README explaining design choices and implementation details, additional design schemas will be valued.
- **Makefile:** Include a Makefile with a run target to simplify running the application.
- **Code Quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Software Architecture:** Structural design choices and scalability considerations.
- **Efficiency:** Optimize for both resources and time efficiency.

## Guidelines

- Use your preferred programming language.
- Feel free to use any libraries, frameworks, or tools that best fit the task.
- Submit your code in the `master` branch of this repository.

## Going the extra mile ðŸš€

To make your solution even stronger, consider:

- **Scalability:** How would you handle a scenario where the provider sends thousands of events with hundreds of zones per event?
- **High Traffic:** How would your service respond to 5k-10k requests per second?
- **Optimization Strategies:** How can the system remain performant under heavy load?

You can implement these enhancements in your code or describe your approach in the README.
